# About
The purpose of this program is to receive circulation reports downloaded from the Vancouver Black Library (VBL)  library management system and output a new csv file that has been reformatted to better suit VBL’s circulation needs along with a text file with a list of cataloging inconsistencies that volunteer catalogers should review and fix.

Currently, VBL’s library management system provides separate circulation statistics for each individual book that is signed out, including book titles with multiple copies owned by VBL. However, volunteers want to be able to view overall circulation statistics for each title, rather than for each copy of a title. The goal of our project is to increase the efficiency of interpreting circulation statistics by consolidating circulation statistics of individual copies of a book into one title.This will create user-friendly documents for VBL volunteers to quickly understand VBL circulation statistics and bring attention to any potential discrepancies in the VBL catalog. 

# Getting Started
1.	Download the circulation report in .csv format from the admin log in at https://www.librarycat.org/lib/VanBlackLibrary and place it in the same folder as circulation.py
2.	Open the command terminal and run circulation.py
3.	Type in the name of the circulation report
4.	Check the folder that circulation.py is located in for the reformatted temp.csv and LibraryThing_reviewlist.txt. Feel free to rename these reports as desired.
